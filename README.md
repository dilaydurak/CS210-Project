# CS210-Project
This Python project analyzes a dataset containing information about kcal burned per week, weather conditions, dates, and cities. The primary goal is to explore the relationship between kcal burned and weather conditions. The project utilizes the `pandas` library for data manipulation and the `scipy.stats` module for statistical analysis, specifically calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient and p-value. The hypothesis testing results provide insights into the existence and strength of a linear correlation between kcal burned and weather. The project also introduces a new calculated variable, 'kcal_per_week_per_weather,' representing the ratio of kcal burned to weather conditions. The accompanying README file explains the steps, methodology, and key findings of the analysis.

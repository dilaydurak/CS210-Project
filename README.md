# CS210-Project
This Python project analyzes a dataset containing information about kcal burned per week, weather conditions, dates, and cities. 
The primary goal is to explore the relationship between kcal burned and weather conditions. 
The project utilizes the pandas library for data manipulation and the scipy.stats module for statistical analysis, specifically calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient and p-value. 
The hypothesis testing results indicate that there is no significant linear correlation between kcal burned and weather conditions. The project also introduces a new calculated variable, 'kcal_per_week_per_weather,' representing the ratio of kcal burned to weather conditions.
